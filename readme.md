# Cybersecurity Internship â€“ Task 5

## Objective
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark and analyze at least three protocols.

---

##  Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (Packet Capture Tool)
- **System:** Windows 10 (with active internet connection)

---

## What I Did

1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Selected my active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3. Started capturing packets and browsed a few websites.
4. Stopped the capture after ~1 minute.
5. Applied filters like `http`, `dns`, and `tcp` to analyze key protocols.
6. Exported the captured packets to `capture.pcapng`.
7. Created this report and uploaded everything to GitHub.

## Key Takeaways

- Learned to use Wireshark to observe real-time network behavior.
- Understood how common protocols like DNS, HTTP, and TCP work.
- Realized how exposed certain traffic can be without encryption (e.g., HTTP).

**Note**: This capture was performed in a controlled environment on my own system.
